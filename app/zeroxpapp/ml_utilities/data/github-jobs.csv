Github Jobs,Jigsaw Trading,C#/.Net Developer - Trading Platforms,"Jigsaw Trading has a niche futures/equity trading platform which is constantly evolving with the markets. We are now looking to grow our team with experienced C# developers that already understand the trading industry, preferably in futures or equities markets. You need to understand the trading industry to do this job.
We are located in Asia, so preference will be given to people in our part of the world as it's easier for time zones. Our team is spread across 6 countries, so we are fine with managing remote developers.
Note that this job is for developers. Our experience with agencies/development companies has been mostly negative. We want to pay developers a decent wage, we do not want to pay an agency to then have a developer working for a very low wage. We want happy developers, not developers getting underpaid by agencies. So agencies/companies - please do not apply, we won't reply. Also - don't seek us out on Skype - we'll just block you there.
So - for you individual developers - we feel that the right candidate will have worked on or been a user of a Trading Platform such as TD Ameritrade, NinjaTrader, Tradestation, MT4, MT5, Jigsaw daytradr etc.
Ideally, they will also have an understanding of the following:

US Futures Market Symbols
Level 1 Data Feed
Level 2 Data Feed
Bar Data/Historical Data Feed
Orders, Positions, Fills
OCO, OSO Order Types

This is more important to us than technical skills.
For technical skills, the following are required:

C#/.NET in a desktop programming environment
Winforms
Some 3rd party library such as DevExpress
MySQL Database
Strong OO skills
Understanding of Multithreading, encapsulation, delegates in C# - both in terms of development AND troubleshooting

We are looking for a new team member to join us on a permanent basis, initially starting off fixing bugs and then moving onto new development.
Our app is 100% multi-threaded and heavily uses OO concepts such as encapsulation. If you have previously been developing web back-ends in C# and don't have an extensive background with multi-threading, this is not the job for you.
You'll need to demonstrate the ability to work on an existing application, which means learning the existing codebase quickly.

We’re looking for an experienced Tech Lead who will take charge of Ridestore internal systems and lead them to the next level of amazing!
Who We Are:
Ridestore was founded over 10 years ago. We had a passion to create products and brands that people truly wanted. The era where brands told people what they should wear or do is dead. Everyone's an expert. You know what you like and want to wear much better than the designer. So our job is to listen. A brand in this new era is there to serve and empower You. The customer. The expert. If you do that well then your brand will spread from one person to another, peer to peer. This changes everything in how you design products and create a brand. You have to truly listen to the customers, not just make them heard. You have to give them a voice and empower them.
We get things done. That has taken us close to half a billion sek in revenue and 100% year on year organic growth. We want to own the outerwear conversation online. Our brands Dope Snow &amp; Montecwear are the first brands created from listening to what You want.
We are a tech-heavy company. There's a reason we see ourselves at the crossroads of fashion and tech; most of our systems, be it logistical, financial or e-commerce are developed in-house. Why? Because we're pushing the line of how a brand operates, and when there's not enough out there that supports us in our quest, we build it ourselves. Our employees, regardless of department, are tech-savvy and look to technology to solve their needs. They rely on our internal systems to be fast-moving (honestly, they're great stakeholders for someone in tech).
We are a remote-friendly company. We don't just say it like others do, we actually mean it. Bigger parts of the company are remote-only even. Our Customer Experience, Marketing and Tech teams are all remote-based.
For this role, you will need to be in our Göteborg, Sweden office for at least first 6-8 months. Your developer team is remote already, but we need you close to the stakeholders (Head of Product Development, CFO, CEO) for a first couple of months to get everything going smoothly. After that, you can be wherever you want. By the way: we provide visa sponsorship and relocation support, so candidates from all over the world are welcome to apply.

Github Jobs,Jigsaw Trading,Javascript/Canvas/Charts Developer ,"Note - no agencies are to apply. We want to work directly with developers only.
We are currently using a set of libraries called ChartIQ within our futures trading application. It's a set of HTML5/Javascript libraries that we have extensively customized.
When we say ""Financial  Charts"" - we mean the sort of charts used by people trading financial markets. This is financial time-series data. Candlestick charts, tick charts, market profile, footprint charts etc.
We need a developer to come on board - someone with both design and coding skills, to help us complete the project. Your skills should at least consist of:

Have knowledge of OOPS in JS.
Should be able to write test cases and good in debugging.
Knowledge of HTML Canvas is must i.e 2D and 3D both.
Worked on a charting library before which uses canvas.
Able to provide clear estimate based on conceptual design coding.

This means that for each major component we develop, we write a design first.
Requirements come from us and you will be writing the design document. We don't want somebody that wants to be coding 100% of the time, we have to agree on the design approach first because performance is essential. We like to think before we code.
We have mostly completed the app but we have some bugs to sort out. The Javascript code is complex and is based on a set of libraries called ""ChartIQ"". We know how to extend ChartIQ but there's a number of issues with the existing code. This job is not for someone that has simply been designing simple websites. There is a lot of number-crunching and performance tuning required.
This person would be able to analyze the existing HTML5/JS code and help us design the last integrations to the other part of our app.
We would prefer someone that has done indicator/similar development on NinjaTrader, MultiCharts, Sierra Charts or some other mainstream platform. Someone that knows a Footprint chart from a Market Profile.
This will be an ongoing project, as we'll always be developing new types of charts to display.
Please quote a MONTHLY rate as this will be an ongoing project of at least 6 months.
Note also - we aren't looking for an agency, we want to work with someone directly. This is not negotiable.

You love web application development and you enjoy seeing businesses grow. You've been in the business for a few years now. You’ve done the whole startup thing and you're ready to find something a little more meaty. Working as one of many developers isn't appealing to you anymore and the commute to San Francisco isn't doing it for you either. You're ready to be part of a team, and you want to own the product vision. You love making great things used by people, not just creating code, but contributing and leading projects to success.
Helio has shown 20% quarter over quarter sales growth, and we need a senior engineer to shape and grow our Helio platform. Specifically we’re looking for a full stack engineer (Front-end -&gt; Ruby on Rails -&gt; Networking/AWS) who wants to own the vision. We're looking for a driven individual to push development forward, work with our active and passionate customers, and take Helio to the next level.
Who we are
We're a team of driven product designers who believe in rapid prototyping, researching on the fly and teaching people how to make better products.

We want to change the way people create products and services to bring behavioral data into everyday creative decisions.
What Your Day Will Look Like

Other days you will be deep into code, addressing architecture or fixing a tricky bug. All the while, working with the team to galvanize the momentum we’ve created with our customers.
You’ll work with our awesome team to learn Progressive Design — ZURB’s flagship design process — and how it applies to Helio. At the end of the day, you'll find that you are more than just a developer, you’re working with a world-class design organization, helping millions of people design for people and making a difference in the product community -- and that's pretty awesome.
What You Bring To The Table

5-10 years of development experience working in a startup, independent contractor, or similar environment.
Should be comfortable in the full stack (Front-end -&gt; Ruby on Rails -&gt; Networking/AWS). You’ll need a solid grasp of Ruby on Rails.
Very comfortable with SQL (We use PostgreSQL and MySQL).
Very comfortable with at least one modern front-end framework (React, VueJS, Angular). We use VueJS and AngularJS as well as Stimulus.
Should be familiar with common software design patterns (observer pattern, facade pattern) .
Should be familiar with server security updates, Ruby security patches, and support third party audits.
Familiarity with AWS (EC2/RDS/VPC/IAM/etc).
Familiarity with video encoding and prototyping tools.
Familiarity with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deploy), we use CircleCI.
Familiarity with generating financial reports, participant payouts and dealing with GDPR requests for removal.

Experience delivering solid products over and over again.
An enthusiasm for coaching and teaching people on our team.

There is no typical day for our Pen Testers.  Our clients rely on us to find a myriad of vulnerabilities across network, application, mobile, cloud, wireless and other assessments.  The benefit of being exposed to so many different situations is that you are constantly building your knowledge base and skill set while keeping up with the latest cloud technologies and endpoint protection.  Our team is remote yet extremely collaborative and works together to utilize their different backgrounds and experience to solve these problems. 
In addition to the hands-on training, Schellman also promotes a continuous learning environment.  Team members are encouraged to attend at least one security conference and training event every year to stay on the cutting edge of the industry.
Responsibilities:
The primary responsibilities for this position will be leading network, application and mobile penetration testing, as well furthering team development and advancing the practice. Senior Penetration Testing Associates perform project execution and report preparation activities as the delivery lead on an engagement.
Requirements:
At least three years hands-on penetration testing experience
At least one year of web application penetration testing experience
Completion of the OSCP Certification

Schellman might not be as well-known, but we are well-liked.  We’ve been recognized in the industry as one of the top Best Small Firms to Work for by Consulting Magazine and Top 10 for Comp and Benefits on Glassdoor, but more importantly, our employees have great things to say about working here:  https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Schellman-and-Company-Reviews-E666239.htm

Github Jobs,Gorgias,Full-Stack Python Engineer,"Gorgias helps e-commerce companies deliver excellent customer service at scale.
Our product creates a unified profile of customers by combining emails, live-chat, and social-media messages with e-commerce data such as purchase and delivery info.
Combining all this data in a single application makes customer service more efficient and just better. Another fortunate side-effect is that some requests are completely automated using ML. 💬 + 📦 = ❤️
We've been around since 2015, and we're currently serving over 2700+ e-commerce businesses, including Steve Madden, Rothys, Timbuk2, and Fjällräven.
Is getting your hands dirty, in a real-world application that touches the lives of millions, your thing? Then yeah, Gorgias is for you.
👩‍💻 What are some of the things we work on?
The frontend is written in React and React Native with the state managed by Redux. The backend code is mostly written in Python3 and runs using Flask (REST API) and Celery for all background work. The state is stored in PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ with Redis for ephemeral storage, and finally, everything runs on Kubernetes.
Given the above, we usually work on one of these levels by improving the existing code, or we create a new feature which more often than not has a component on both frontend, backend, and maybe a migration in the database.
In short, we do full-stack development. Either way, it always good to have a good understanding of the entire stack to be effective.
🧙 Who are we at work?
We have a strong preference for people who worked with high-traffic web applications for the past 3+ years.  We're essentially running a distributed system that has lots of moving parts and having a decent amount of experience with this type of system helps a lot!
Additionally, our apps have over 10k daily active users with sessions longer than 6h+/day and serve tens of millions of consumers per year, so we put great importance on quality, testing, and code-review of all our code. Our apps have big codebases, and we have to feel comfortable about navigating and progressively improving them. Sometimes, however, we gotta get dirty and figure out why the 10Tb+ DB is slow or why some k8s pod is not running correctly, figure out how to successfully retry a failing API request, etc... The end goal is to hide a lot of complexity from the user and make their life easier.
If this is the type of environment you're looking for, then you should consider applying.
Note: this is a remote position, preferably for European countries due to time zone preference.
About You

3+ years of experience developing production-grade backend web applications using Python or JS.
3+ years of experience doing front-end development with JS.
You are passionate about learning and want to help us learn too.
You care about working on applications that are putting the customer needs first.
You are comfortable communicating with other technical teams and management to collect requirements, describe software product features, demo work in progress, and provide project updates.
You have the drive and focus to get challenging projects over the finish line, and you are comfortable advocating for what you need to do your best work.
You thrive in a fast-paced environment.

Nice to Have

Experience in designing API/microservices is a huge plus.
Experience with managing RDMS databases with 10Tb+ of data.
Company Benefits &amp; Perks
Competitive salary, equity packages, and performance bonus packages
4 weeks of vacation and parental leave
Latest MacBook Pro or equivalent
Retirement benefits
Unlimited snacks

Github Jobs,You Need A Budget (YNAB),Humbly Confident Senior Android Developer,"About Us and Why We’re Hiring
We build “You Need a Budget”, the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”.) For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. Google us, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.
YNAB is growing, and so is our product team. Our software ecosystem includes personal budgeting apps for web, iOS, and Android. We have some big plans for our Android app, and that’s where you might come in.
Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):

You must have at least five years of professional software development experience.
At least 4 of those years were spent writing Android apps.

But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. Let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about who we’re looking for.
We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Core Value Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!
Who you’d be working with:
Our developer team is about 20 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.
Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: they are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments, big egos, and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.
And of course, as a developer, you’ll get to work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the design/development process, and are technically savvy enough to continuously improve our development workflow. For example, check out this post that Emily wrote describing how we handle semantic colors across all of our apps.
How You’ll Work at YNAB
We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named one of Fortune’s Best Small Companies to Work For) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:
Live Where You Want
We’re a fully remote team, so you can live and work just about wherever you want, as long as it’s somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.
No Crazy Hours
We have only worked more than 40 hours per week in extremely rare circumstances. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul; no need to go crazy on the hours.
Take Vacation (Seriously)
We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our #office_wall Slack channel.
The YNAB Retreat
We get everyone together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding! So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, Laguna Beach. We play together, and reinforce the bonds we’ve made as a team and company. Every year, we leave refreshed, motivated, and excited for the year ahead together.
Up Your Game
We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing in their craft.
International is Absolutely Okay
If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)
Benefits
For our US employees, we offer fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, we’ve got you covered!)
We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)
Other Tidbits

Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)
We give personalized birthday and holiday gifts. (And where possible, these help with the aforementioned bucket list items.)
We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.
We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.
We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a top of the line computer and phone and will replace them regularly.
Did we mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives?

If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB users gain control of their money. You will change lives.
Now, back to you, our new Senior Android Developer...
You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional experience, with most of those being spent working on Android. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.
You'll help us write and maintain features in our Android app. We believe in the power of native user interfaces on each platform, and are incredibly excited about Jetpack Compose, but we’re also the sort of folks who get excited about elegantly sharing business logic across all our platforms. To that end, we have a home-built shared library based on Typescript and SQLite that uses the V8 engine. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer definitely helps.
We’re already spiking on integrating Kotlin Multiplatform as well, and have some exciting proof-of-concept code committed to all of our platforms, so this is also a great time to get in at the start of a big Kotlin push.
Some technologies we use on Android:

minSdkVersion 23
Kotlin for all new code
Moving towards a unidirectional data flow architecture
ViewBinding
Integrating with V8 JS engine
RxJava, Dagger, Robolectric
Bitrise CI
Github
SQLite (and thus SQL)
Typescript

You’re the one we’re looking for if you:

Write code that is easy for other developers and your future self to understand and use.
Have extensive experience with Kotlin and Java.
Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for Android.
Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are unlikely, but discoverable if they do happen.
Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:
""This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?""
""This component needs to be re-architected to allow for new feature X. How do you think we should do it?""
“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout function. Can you investigate?”
Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.
Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures that goes beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.
Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.
Feel right at home with Git/Github, and can happily talk about the pros and cons of different Git branching models and workflows.
“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)

YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe a diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.

A few examples of your responsibilities:
*Migrate our portfolio of world-renowned iOS apps to the most recent Android version, making them available to a whole new user base.
*Contribute to the product development of the apps you’ll work on. We’re all about taking a proactive role and ownership of your work.

*Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that WOW factor to put a smile on our users’ faces.
*Stay up to speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.
What We Offer
*Huge impact. You’ll be working on apps used by millions of people all around the world. The quality of your work will make a decisive difference—both to the users and to Bending Spoons as a whole.
*Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. You’ll get the chance to learn from—and teach —some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.

*Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring and you’re entrepreneurial in seeking out new opportunities and testing ideas of your own accord. You seek—you don’t just wait to be told what to do.
*A knack for UX and attention to detail. You care about developing quality user experiences, and notice the details that make a difference. You get a kick out of making a UI or an animation just perfect.
*Diligence, organization. You can be entrusted with responsibilities big and small.
*Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to get your hands dirty with whatever the team needs to succeed.
*Proficient in English. You read, write, and speak fluently in English.
*Availability. We work 9-6 GMT+1. Our schedule is flexible, but we prefer to work together most of the time. That’s why you should live somewhere with a similar timezone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.

Github Jobs,Microsoft,Software Engineer - Site Reliability Engineering (SRE),"At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more. As a member of our engineering team, you will play an integral part in making that happen, navigating us into the future and impacting the lives of people all around the world.
Software Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers are Microsoft Future Navigators
Microsoft has been a leading company in computing for decades. We are a global operation, relied on by governments, utilities, schools, and co-operatives to deliver the things they need to work, every day. 
In order to make this work for our customers, we need continual effort to make that delivery reliable. In order to drive reliability, we need you -- someone who already is, or is interested in becoming, a Site Reliability Engineer (also known as SRE). 
SREs are people who take engineering-based approaches to solve operations problems: we like infrastructure, we like seeing how big complicated things work, and most importantly, we gain great satisfaction from making it better. We have backgrounds in lots of things -- of course, Computer Science, System Administration, Networking, Mathematics, and Engineering generally, but you can also find folks who've worked in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Statistics, and even English. 
SREs build, monitor, and maintain the systems and infrastructure that ensure our customers can quickly access their data and run workloads whenever and wherever they need to. We identify service problems and areas for improvement, and we follow up by fixing those problems. Our work is key to the success of many of the Microsoft services you'll have heard of, and a number you haven't. There are very few bits of Microsoft which aren't touched by SREs in some way or other. 
SREs come in two kinds: SRE-SWE (people with a software engineering background), and SRE-SE (people with a systems engineering background). 
SREs with a software engineering background can come from industry and academia. Their distinguishing feature is their inclination to, and demonstrated competence in, working with software. An SRE-SWE could be successful in perhaps any software team, but typically has an interest in infrastructure, scale, performance, or the behaviour of distributed systems generally. Since how software is written determines the behaviour of a system generally, often in subtle or initially misunderstood ways, an SRE-SWE cares deeply about software quality and how software is constructed. Release processes, safe deployments, measuring performance, and similar concerns beyond pure functionality are important to SREs and are relevant to improving reliability. If this resonates with you, we'd like to talk. 
Responsibilities
The scale of our operations is enormous. Microsoft's products and services are overwhelmingly consumed online, and billions of people use them every day. We need people who enjoy analyzing complicated problems, coming up with creative solutions, working in focused teams to build things no-one has thought of before, all in the service of production reliability. 
If you are excited by this type of challenge, and you love to work in groups of people who are similarly excited, come join us. We value the input of people who aren't afraid to be learning all the time, who celebrate mistakes because they show the way forward, and those who are happy to continuously improve. We strongly believe that diverse experiences and backgrounds, and an environment where everyone can feel safe to contribute their own insights in a data-driven, objective, but the supportive way is the key to making the best workplace possible, and the best workplace makes the best products and services. Not only is it the smart thing, it's the right thing. 
Responsibilities will include:

Communicate effectively and partner well with other disciplines of the project team to deliver high quality solutions from ideas to production code

Github Jobs,Rijksoverheid,Senior forensisch software-engineer AI en data-science,"Senior forensisch software-engineer AI en data-science
Ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid, Nederlands Forensisch Instituut
Functieomschrijving
Uitdagende forensische vraagstukken oplossen met behulp van machine learning ondersteunende software: dat doe je als forensisch software-engineer bij het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut in Den Haag. Jij bent helemaal into softwareontwikkeling én ziet het als een uitdaging om met jouw programmeerkennis een belangrijke bijdrage te leveren aan onderwerpen met een maatschappelijke impact. Werk samen met ons aan waarheidsvinding in strafzaken en innovatieve onderzoeksprojecten. Kijk jij ernaar uit om state-of-the-art-artificial intelligence in een forensisch vakgebied in te zetten?
Je maakt deel uit van het team Forensische Big Data Analyse, dat bestaat uit achttien collega’s. Wij zijn technisch onderlegde data-scientists en richten ons op het spectrum van statistiek tot software-engineering, en zoeken versterking op het gebied van engineering. Samen passen wij state-of-the-art-machinelearning-technieken toe voor opsporing en bewijswaardering. Wij zetten ons in voor strafzaken, consultancyprojecten voor overheidspartners en doen onze eigen research en development.
Je werkt met allerlei soorten data: van vrije tekst en politiedatabases tot miljoenen afbeeldingen en blockchains. Door het ontwerpen en implementeren van software zorg je dat onze opdrachtgevers meer uit deze data kunnen halen. Omdat iedere opdracht anders is, lever je altijd maatwerk en is het belangrijk dat je de juiste vragen weet te stellen aan opdrachtgevers, zoals de Nationale Politie en het Openbaar Ministerie.
Vaak ben je in een klein team één tot twee maanden met een project of zaak bezig. Jij geeft richting aan de implementatie en architectuur van de onderliggende software. Deze software kan zeer divers zijn. Zo ontwikkelen we bijvoorbeeld gebruikersinterfaces, onze eigen deep learning libraries (TensorFlow-based) en dataverwerkings-pipelines. Dit maakt het werk extra dynamisch en uitdagend. Jouw software kan de doorslag geven in een grote strafzaak!
Naast je vakinhoudelijke werkzaamheden denk je ook mee over de verdere ontwikkeling van data-science binnen het NFI. Zo ben je betrokken bij onze research en development om het forensische vakgebied op het hoogste niveau te houden. Je houdt de nieuwe ontwikkelingen binnen het machine learning-vakgebied in de gaten en zet deze in om het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut haar taken beter uit te laten voeren.
Als zelforganiserend team hebben wij regie over ons werkproces. We werken in afwisselende scrum-teams aan zaken, projecten en onze eigen research en development. In deze agile-omgeving staan samenwerken en kennis delen centraal.
Voorbeelden van projecten waarmee je aan de slag kunt:

Het ontwikkelen van deep-learning-modellen voor het herkennen van vuurwapens in miljoenen afbeeldingen.
Een monitor bouwen die dagelijks het nieuws op het gebied van bitcoins binnenhaalt en automatisch trending topics en interessante ontwikkelingen binnen deze berichten bepaalt.
Het ontwikkelen van een active-learning-systeem om rechercheurs in staat te stellen onze modellen zelf te trainen. Hierbij werken verschillende REST-services met elkaar samen.
Het structureren van grote hoeveelheden tekst in een grote verzameling van cold cases, door entiteiten en onderwerpen te herkennen met neurale netwerken en clusteringtechnieken.

Wil je meer weten over ons werk? Bekijk dan de video Misdaad opsporen via big data voor een kijkje in de keuken.
Functie-eisen

Je hebt een relevante wo-opleiding afgerond, zoals informatica, of een technische opleiding met een sterke software-engineeringcomponent.
Je hebt ervaring met het ontwerpen van softwarearchitecturen.
Je hebt ervaring met (micro/REST-)services.
Je hebt ervaring met webdevelopment: HTML, CSS en JavaScript.
Je hebt ervaring met Python, en met Java of andere gecompileerde talen.
Je hebt ervaring met relationele databases.
Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met Elasticsearch en NoSQL databases.
Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met Keras, TensorFlow en Pytorch.
Je spreekt en schrijft goed Nederlands.

Competenties

analyseren;
oordeelsvorming;
samenwerken;
overtuigingskracht;
plannen en organiseren;
creativiteit.

Wat vinden wij nog meer belangrijk
Je bent in staat om complexe projecten en processen te doorgronden en te sturen op resultaat. Analytisch ben jij ijzersterk. Je toont initiatief, deelt je kennis en maakt je ideeën en gedachten op een transparante wijze bespreekbaar. Feedback geef en ontvang je op een professionele en constructieve kritische manier. Maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen op het gebied van big data en strafrecht mogen rekenen op jouw oprechte belangstelling. Vanuit die betrokkenheid wil je jezelf blijven ontwikkelen, vakinhoudelijk én persoonlijk. Je bent in staat vanuit een coachende rol jouw (junior) data-science-collega’s technisch te begeleiden en motiveert je collega’s om betrokkenheid en actie te tonen bij de doelen die zijn gesteld in het project en binnen het team.

Position Overview
Clarity, a Series A clean-tech startup, is looking for an experienced full-stack tech lead to spearhead our software team and join the mission of bringing clear air to the world. He or she will drive the technical evolution of our IoT sensor data pipeline, customer-facing web applications, and data analysis tools. Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Oakland, CA.
Our Company
At Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.
Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.
We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action.
Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.
After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors here and here), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.
Our Team
We are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges.
We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create.
Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team. How else could you tackle a problem as complex and global as air pollution?
Job Description
We are seeking a highly self-motivated and passionate full-stack developer who is comfortable with both front-end and back-end development . As a Full-Stack developer, we expect you to work closely with other members in our Software Development Team (we have 3 developers at the moment) to see through projects from conceptions to final products.
On the development side, you will work on:

Developing new web applications to deliver value and insight from monitoring data to our customers, as well as visual and user interaction designs.
Exploring ways to visualize complex time series air quality data and data from other sources (e.g. meteorological, traffic, land use, etc.) in a clear and insightful manner.
Developing new services, architecture, and technology to enable new use cases for our sensing-as-a-service solution.
Constantly improving the performance, scalability, and reliability of our system given the growing size of our sensor networks.

Our product is multidisciplinary, ranging from ubiquitous IoT hardware to scalable data pipelines, advanced data quality assurance algorithms and insightful data analyses. You will enjoy freedom of action around these topics and be encouraged to take initiative for making our software offerings truly revolutionary in the clean-tech space.
You will have plenty of opportunity to work closely with our customers and end-users who hail from industry, government, NGOs, community groups, and academia. We believe Clarity could be the right place for you to join the fight to environmental issues around the world by leveraging your software superpowers!
Qualifications
